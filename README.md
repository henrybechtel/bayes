# Introduction to Bayesian Inference 
by Henry Bechtel

I have found many introductions to Bayesian analysis either too simplistic or too complex. 

I think focusing largely on grid methods is a good middle-ground that offers insight into how Bayesian inference works. In this repo I have spent sometime writing out some examples in various languanges.

Here we will go beyond simple, toy examples, pushing grid approximation to its limits so we can see why MCMC methods are required for more complex problems.

Special thanks to excellent, inspirational work by Allen Downey, Richard McElreath, and Brandon Rohrer.
